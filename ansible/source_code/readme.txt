	Andrew Klassen is the developer and license owner of this project and therefore
	is the only person who has any and all authoritative power over this project. 
	
	There are, however, two other open source projects that are consolidated with
	this project. The first one is phpMyAdmin. All source code for this project is 
	located under the php_my_admin directory. The second one is a library called 
	phpseclib which is located under the php directory. phpMyAdmin is licensed under
	the GPL v3. phpseclib is under the MIT license, copyright Jim Wigginton. If you
	wish to do any work that involves the source code to either one or both of these
	projects, then your work must comply with the licenses that your work is 
	deriving from.
	
	Although this project was written by one man, there were many who have contributed
	their time in order to ensure that this program is "Enterprise Grade". Below is a list
	of every person who took part in the program's beta testing period. If you create work
	that derives from this project, then you must include the list of names below into your
	project because these are the people who have ensured that your project has a stable
	foundation.
